# Final-CS639
The Final mini-capstone project for Mobile App Development that simulates healthy food planning


 
The Problem
College students typically have a meal plan associated with their student id. With that there are either not too many healthy food items or in some cases they would choose items without regard to any nutritional benefit or the health risks. What people do not realize is that there are many harmful effects to the human body associated with poor nutrition according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC). Such risks consist of overweight and obesity, Type 2 diabetes, cancer and even the development of eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia. Additionally, 9 in 10 Americans consume wholesome amounts of sodium and sugar and nearly $173 billion is spent on nutritional healthcare. All of these are major health problems in a college student’s plate and something needs to be done in terms of helping college students navigate their meal plan options in a healthy manner
 
Objectives:

•	To simplify the process of meal planning and preparation.
•	To educate users about the nutritional content of their meals.
•	To cater to various dietary preferences, including vegetarian, non-vegetarian, and vegan.

Description: Users find this app essential for planning grocery shopping runs and for organizing recipes. Lists are shareable with roommates/partners/spouses. 


            

Why we stand out from any of these?
We are specifically helping college students manage their meal plans in a more ethical and responsible manner. For this reason, our backend database will be composed of local college dining hall menu items and their nutritional value. The other apps on the other hand target the general public or household owners, yet we feel that it is important for college students to develop those skills before going out into the real world.
